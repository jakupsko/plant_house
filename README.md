# Smart Planter

There are already a lot of open-source projects controlling plant growing conditions. This one is not special, but it is mine. Since I am doing the work anyway, I figured I might as well share it with anybody interested. My goal was to learn 3D printing, electronics design, micropython,  and GitHub, so to some this planter might appear way over-engineered. I am also doing this in my free time (i.e., nights and weekends), so progress is slow. For anyone interested in following what I have done, I will post step-by-step instructions here and upload any relevant files you might need to replicate my results. 


## Micropython code:

I used a Raspberry Pi Pico W for this project, which can run micropython code. The folder [micropython](https://github.com/jakupsko/plant_house/tree/main/micropython) has files I individually designed to be self-contained (i.e., can be used for other projects).
